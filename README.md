Visualize Data with a Bar Chart
===============================
Data Visualization Projects
---------------------------

A simple bar chart takes data from API and by using D3 library shows it.

This is the educational project and task from FreeCodeCamp course. It was made on August 14, 2017, and on August 23, 2019 I slightly refactored it to pass the tests in the new version of the course.
